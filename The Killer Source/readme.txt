The Killer
A notgame by Jordan Magnuson
Created for GameTrekking.com
========================================================================

Language:	AS3

Libraries:	Flashpunk (flashpunk.net)

Built in:	FlashDevelop (project file included)

The source code for this game is completely free and open: use it
in whatever way you'd like. If you find it helpful, or make anything
particular with it, I'd love to hear about it! Send an email to
jm.magnuson@gmail.com.

Notes: 

- The game was built on top of one of my previous efforts (Walk or Die)
  in a terribly haphazard way. If you're interested in the basic
  code behind the procedural world generation or day/night cycle, I
  recommend that you download the Walk or Die code separately from
  https://github.com/JordanMagnuson/Walk-or-Die .

- The FlashPunk library is covered by its own license, which can be found 
  in the flashpunk directory.
